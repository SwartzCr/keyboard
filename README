This is a repository of all of the code neede to make my keyboard.
Along with a number of openscad programs there are raw dxf files that were used
    to cut the stabilizing plate. The code for the micro is all written by jesse vincent, and available here: https://github.com/obra/KeyboardioFirmware
    and I've added my qwerty layout file to this repo, so that if my computer loses it
    I can still reprogram my microcontroller.
